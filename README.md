# -Projects-TikTok-commercial-video-advertisements-detect-Who-can-make-the-accuracy-0.99
The purpose of the project is to predict the label and make the accuracy 0.99?
For the prediction, we used Random Forest as the base model to see how good it will perform, including the Neural network- (sklearn's Multiple Perception Classifier/keras) . To build the models we used 5 basic layers and this set of neurons-(16,32,64,32,16). To make the model more complex, we added dropout, more layers, and changing the number of neurons and tried different activation functions like relu.
